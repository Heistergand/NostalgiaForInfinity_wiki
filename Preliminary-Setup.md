# Freqtrade Setup and Syncing with Private Repo

Depending upon your OS , Freqtrade installation can differ to quite an extent . There are primarily 2 ways to do it either installing natively to your OS or using Docker . If you are really constrained with the resources you have go the native route , but it is highly recommended to use the Docker Installation since majority of the users use it and most development will be catering to that user base , plus its easier to get everything else configured once you have Docker Setup . You can check the [Freqtrade docs](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/installation/) for the other methods , we will be covering the docker method of things for sake of keeping things simple.
